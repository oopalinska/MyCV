## General info
I think it is a bit naive to just focus on back-end when you want to become a Java developer.\
That is why I've decided to try and make my resume as a simple webpage.\
You can display it in English and Polish version (to change the language, just click the flag icon in the upper right corner).

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS
* FontAwesome5

## Setup
The webpage has been published under GitHub Pages, so you can check it out under this link:

## Status
Project is: _in progress_ \
This is my first HTML/CSS code and it is definitely not too clean.<br/> I'm willing to understand better what is going on there and fix it in the future.\
For now, I'm happy it's working :)

## Inspiration
Project inspired by tutorial by @flynerdpl
